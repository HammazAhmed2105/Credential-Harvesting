# Hands-On Credential Harvesting Lab Using SEToolkit on Kali Linux
<h2>Lab Objective</h2>
Learn how to harvest credentials by utilizing a cloned site
<h2>Lab Tool - Kali linux in Virtual Machine</h2>

We will be using the setoolkit - The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) was created and written by Dave Kennedy, the founder of TrustedSec. It is an open-source Python-driven tool aimed at penetration testing around Social-Engineering. 
We will be doing credential harvesting i.e password harvesting or username harvesting, is a form of cyberattack that involves the theft of personal or financial data such as usernames and passwords, typically carried out through phishing, malicious websites, email scams, or malware but not always.
<h2>Download Setoolkit</h2>
Download the tool on your kali linux - git clone https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit
<h3>Step 1 – Start setoolkit by using the command “sudo setoolkit”. </h3>

<h3>Step2 – Choose the following options one after another. Social Engineering Attacks > Website Attack Vectors > Credential Harvester Attack Method. Refer to the below image.</h3>

<h3>Step 3 - The next menu will ask you which method you want to choose to harvest a victim’s credentials. In this lab we will be cloning a site, so choose option 2.</h3>

<H3>Step 4 – Now we have to enter our local machine(Kali linux in this instance) IP address. If you don’t know it then open a new terminal and type “ifconfig”. 
Enter the Ip address and then the web address of the site you wanna clone. I am using Instagram for this example.

<h3>Step 5 -  Return to your web browser and enter the IP address specified in step 4. A phishing page designed to imitate Facebook will appear. Any usernames and passwords entered on this page will be sent to your Kali machine.</h3>

<h3>Step- 6 Return to the terminal where SET is active. You'll observe a substantial amount of text generated by the numerous POST requests transmitted from the replicated website. Continue scrolling down until you encounter the username and password values. At this point, you should be able to view the entered username and password in plaintext on the cloned site..</h3>
